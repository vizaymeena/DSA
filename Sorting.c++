What is Sorting?
                Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order (ascending or descending). 
                It is a fundamental concept in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and is widely used in searching, databases, and optimization problems.

Types of Sorting Algorithms :
                             Comparison-Based Sorting       (Uses comparisons to order elements)
                             Non-Comparison-Based Sorting   (Uses counting or hashing instead of comparisons)


------ COMPARISION BASED -------
 1. Bubble Sort
 2. Selection Sort
 3. Insertion Sort
 4. Merge Sort
 5. Quick Sort

 ------- NON-COMPARISION BASED --------
 1. Counting Sort
                Concept: Count occurrences of elements and place them in correct positions.
                
 2. Radix Sort
                Concept: Sort numbers digit by digit (using Counting Sort as a subroutine).




--->  Bubble Sort    :    Concept: Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
--->  Selection Sort :    Concept: Repeatedly select the smallest element and move it to the correct position.
--->  Insertion Sort :    Concept: Insert each element into its correct position in a sorted portion of the array.
--->  Merge Sort     :    Concept: Divide and Conquer â†’ Divide array into halves, sort them, and merge
--->  Quick Sort     :    Concept: Select a pivot, partition the array, then recursively sort subarrays.
